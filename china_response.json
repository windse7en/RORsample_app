Paul Chapman reports.\n▲ Hide Transcript\n▶ View Transcript\nFor the families of the passengers and crew of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 it\u0027s another long day of waiting and hoping. Australia\u0027s set up a new joint agency to co-ordinate support for the international search and keep the relatives informed. It\u0027s leader, a former Australian defence chief, says all available information points to the area they\u0027re scouring now. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CHIEF CO-ORDINATOR OF THE JOINT AGENCY CO-ORDINATION CENTRE (JACC), ANGUS HOUSTON, SAYING: \"I fully support the fact that we are out there searching the areas we\u0027re searching. We\u0027re looking where the calculations, the modelling suggests that the best chance of success will be.\" As the search goes on into its fourth week Malaysian authorities on Monday revealed the last words from the cockpit of the missing plane were a standard \"Good night Malaysian three seven zero\" They originally said the critical last communication was a more casual \"All right, good night.\" Aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas says the admission won\u0027t help Malaysia\u0027s already tarnished reputation with the families of the missing people. (SOUNDBITE) (English) EDITOR OF AIRLINERATINGS.COM, GEOFFREY THOMAS SAYING: \"The admission today by the Malaysian government that the last words were not correct as reported, is extraordinary. That it\u0027s taken three weeks to correct this, and unfortunately this just gives the families of those, the families of the victims, more evidence that things have been hidden from them if you like, it supports that particular theory.\" The United States, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan are all scouring an area some 2,000 km west of the Australian city of Perth, where investigators believe the plane came down. So far, the search has turned up only fishing rubbish and other flotsam and has been halted several times by bad weather.\n•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t\nPlane search area \u0027best chance of success\u0027\nTuesday, Apr 01, 2014 - 01:53\nMost Popular » \nIslamic State says beheads U.S. journalist, holds anotherIslamic State says beheads U.S. journalist,... \nTue, Aug 19, 2014 - (2:27)\nIraqi refugee camp expands to cope with overwhelming numbers Iraqi refugee camp expands to cope with... \nWed, Aug 20, 2014 - (1:15)\nTensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into Ukraine Tensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into... \n11:20am EDT - (1:25)\nBreakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas Breakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas \n10:19am EDT - (2:55)\n3-year-old girl dies after Maryland police shootout 3-year-old girl dies after Maryland police... \nSun, Aug 17, 2014 - (0:46)\nIs it a plane?

Rajesh Adhikari\u0027s device works by using energy generated through walking or running, giving him a reliable source of energy to keep his phone charged at all times. Jim Drury reports.\n▲ Hide Transcript\n▶ View Transcript\nFor many people, running is the ideal form of exercise, but now, thanks to a schoolboy in northern India, it could begin to empower millions in a new way. Rajesh Adhikari has invented a prototype mobile phone charger, comprised of a spring and dynamo system, that fits inside his running shoe. It produces electricity as he walks or runs. SOUNDBITE (Hindi) RAJESH ADHIKARI, SHOE CHARGER CREATOR, SAYING: \"When you raise your feet, the spring gets released and the dynamo starts revolving, which generates current. Every time you press your foot it generates a charge. You can charge your mobile phone while walking.\" Adhikari says the idea came after heavy snowfall left his and other neighbourhood homes in the town of Nainital without electricity. His device can not only keep a cell-phone charged, it can also power a small light bulb, which Adhikari believes could ease the stress for households in future power cuts. And the High School student has aspirations to modify his design, so it works wirelessly to charge a cell phone in the wearer\u0027s pocket. He\u0027s not the only innovator looking to develop shoe-based power generation...but Adhikari says he\u0027s determined to put his best foot forward.\n•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t\nStudent sees the light with walking power\nSunday, Mar 30, 2014 - 01:18\nTop News » \nHamas-led gunmen execute 18 \"collaborators\" in GazaHamas-led gunmen execute 18 \"collaborators\" in... \n1:59pm EDT - (1:20)\nClashes erupt during West Bank demonstrations Clashes erupt during West Bank demonstrations \n11:56am EDT - (1:05)\nBreakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas Breakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas \n10:19am EDT - (2:55)\nUN: Syrian death toll just over 191,000 UN: Syrian death toll just over 191,000 \n10:53am EDT - (1:45)\nTensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into Ukraine Tensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into... \n11:20am EDT - (1:25)\nFerguson sees much-needed calm as guard pulls out Ferguson sees much-needed calm as guard pulls... \n9:19am EDT - (1:21)\nRain hampers landslide rescue in Japan Rain hampers landslide rescue in Japan \n6:49am EDT - (1:21)\nFirst Malaysian bodies arrive home First Malaysian bodies arrive home \n4:57am EDT - (1:23)\nIndonesia court upholds Widodo\u0027s presidential victory Indonesia court upholds Widodo\u0027s presidential... \n3:07am EDT - (1:22)\nBreakingviews: Jackson Hole Special Breakingviews: Jackson Hole Special \n4:30am EDT - (5:16)\nMichael Brown\u0027s mother: \"He was just tall, big, and black\" Michael Brown\u0027s mother: \"He was just tall,... \nThu, Aug 21, 2014 - (1:02)\nU.S. pursuing long-term strategy against ISIL: Hagel U.S. pursuing long-term strategy against ISIL:... \nThu, Aug 21, 2014 - (1:31)\n \nMost Popular » \nIslamic State says beheads U.S. journalist, holds anotherIslamic State says beheads U.S. journalist,... \nTue, Aug 19, 2014 - (2:27)\nIraqi refugee camp expands to cope with overwhelming numbers Iraqi refugee camp expands to cope with... \nWed, Aug 20, 2014 - (1:15)\nTensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into Ukraine Tensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into... \n11:20am EDT - (1:25)\nBreakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas Breakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas \n10:19am EDT - (2:55)\n3-year-old girl dies after Maryland police shootout 3-year-old girl dies after Maryland police... \nSun, Aug 17, 2014 - (0:46)\nIs it a plane?

Brazil\u0027s military is moving in, taking over a slum known as Complexo da Mare. They\u0027re on a mission to end a recent surge in violent crime and prevent further conflict ahead of the World Cup. More than 1,400 Brazilian troops and police entered the slum, located in the city\u0027s north zone not far from Rio\u0027s international airport. During the operation, troops confiscated drugs and guns. Rio\u0027s governor had ordered the operation after attacks by drug traffickers on police posts in the area. An estimated 140,000 people live there in what officials say is Rio\u0027s latest \"pacified\" favela.\n•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t\nBrazilian troops occupy Rio slum ahead of World Cup\nSunday, Mar 30, 2014 - 00:51\nMost Popular » \nIslamic State says beheads U.S. journalist, holds anotherIslamic State says beheads U.S. journalist,... \nTue, Aug 19, 2014 - (2:27)\nIraqi refugee camp expands to cope with overwhelming numbers Iraqi refugee camp expands to cope with... \nWed, Aug 20, 2014 - (1:15)\nTensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into Ukraine Tensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into... \n11:20am EDT - (1:25)\nUN: Syrian death toll just over 191,000 UN: Syrian death toll just over 191,000 \n10:53am EDT - (1:45)\nIslamic State tells Iraqi minorities: convert or die Islamic State tells Iraqi minorities: convert... \nThu, Aug 21, 2014 - (1:15)\nBreakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas Breakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas \n10:19am EDT - (2:55)\nU.S. pursuing long-term strategy against ISIL: Hagel U.S. pursuing long-term strategy against ISIL:... \nThu, Aug 21, 2014 - (1:31)\nTwo U.S. Ebola patients have recovered, both discharged from Atlanta hospital Two U.S. Ebola patients have recovered, both... \nThu, Aug 21, 2014 - (1:22)\n3-year-old girl dies after Maryland police shootout 3-year-old girl dies after Maryland police... \nSun, Aug 17, 2014 - (0:46)\nBreakingviews: Jackson Hole Special Breakingviews: Jackson Hole Special \n4:30am EDT - (5:16)\nRain hampers landslide rescue in Japan Rain hampers landslide rescue in Japan \n6:49am EDT - (1:21)\nFerguson sees much-needed calm as guard pulls out Ferguson sees much-needed calm as guard pulls... \n9:19am EDT - (1:21)\n \nMoney » \nS\u0026P 500 closes at new highS\u0026P 500 closes at new high \nThu, Aug 21, 2014 - (1:24)\nS\u0026P 500 just shy of record S\u0026P 500 just shy of record \nWed, Aug 20, 2014 - (2:23)\nApple hits $100 a share Apple hits $100 a share \nTue, Aug 19, 2014 - (2:06)\nNasdaq closes at 14-year high Nasdaq closes at 14-year high \nMon, Aug 18, 2014 - (2:23)\nPutin puts Wall Street in buying mood Putin puts Wall Street in buying mood \nThu, Aug 14, 2014 - (2:10)\nWe\u0027ve become a promotional culture-RetailMeNot\u0027s Bodge We\u0027ve become a promotional... \nThu, Aug 14, 2014 - (4:39)\nDow back to positive territory for year Dow back to positive territory for year \nWed, Aug 13, 2014 - (2:18)\nMarkets continue recovery from geopolitical drop Markets continue recovery from geopolitical... \nMon, Aug 11, 2014 - (2:09)\nMarkets cheer Russia\u0027s Ukraine exit Markets cheer Russia\u0027s Ukraine exit \nFri, Aug 08, 2014 - (1:50)\nRussia, Iraq push Dow to three-month low Russia, Iraq push Dow to three-month low \nThu, Aug 07, 2014 - (2:27)\nWall Street gains but telecom disconnected Wall Street gains but telecom disconnected \nWed, Aug 06, 2014 - (2:28)\nStocks zapped by energy weakness Stocks zapped by energy weakness \nTue, Aug 05, 2014 - (2:46)\nThe Exchange » \nThe Exchange: Hot commodityThe Exchange: Hot commodity \nWed, Jul 16, 2014 - (9:25)\nThe Exchange: Constitutional crusade The Exchange: Constitutional crusade \nWed, Jun 25, 2014 - (11:35)\nThe Exchange: The value of money The Exchange: The value of money \nMon, Jun 02, 2014 - (9:53)\nThe Exchange: China’s Second Continent The Exchange: China’s Second Continent \nTue, May 27, 2014 - (9:35)\nThe Exchange: A master of business arts The Exchange: A master of business arts \nThu, May 08, 2014 - (8:24)\nThe Exchange: America\u0027s bankrupt cities The Exchange: America\u0027s bankrupt cities \nMon, May 05, 2014 - (8:52)\nThe Exchange: Assessing Abenomics\u0027 Third Arrow The Exchange: Assessing Abenomics\u0027 Third Arrow \nWed, Apr 30, 2014 - (11:44)\nThe Exchange: From capitalism to collaboration The Exchange: From capitalism to collaboration \nTue, Apr 15, 2014 - (10:19)\nThe Exchange: Let the rocking commence The Exchange: Let the rocking commence \nTue, Apr 08, 2014 - (8:13)\nThe Exchange: The uncertainty of paper money The Exchange: The uncertainty of paper money \nWed, Apr 02, 2014 - (9:16)\nThe Exchange: The Moneyball fallacies The Exchange: The Moneyball fallacies \nMon, Mar 24, 2014 - (9:54)\nIs doing good a good business?

Nathan Frandino reports.\n▲ Hide Transcript\n▶ View Transcript\nThe prayers continue in Maidan. Forty days after a mass of protesters died in violence in Kiev\u0027s Independence Square, mourners gather to honor the dead. As they lay endless bouquets of flowers, mourners promise the deaths won\u0027t be in vain. (SOUNDBITE) (Ukrainian) KIEV RESIDENT, OKSANA GRYGORENKA, SAYING: \"I think the dead are saints. They are called the \u0027heavenly hundred\u0027. We will be grateful to them until the end of our lives for fighting for our justice and freedom. I\u0027m looking forward to the May 25 elections. I\u0027m waiting with a kind of fear and impatience. I think it will be a kind of turning point in our life. We must take it very seriously.\" Kiev leaders say it is essential to remember the victims - especially while weighing tough decisions to pull Ukraine out of political and economic crisis. (SOUNDBITE) (Ukrainian) HEAD OF KIEV CITY ADMINISTRATION, VOLODYMYR BONDARENKO, SAYING: \"The city authority will take all measures to keep the deaths in people\u0027s memories. Without any doubt after discussions with architects and according to public opinion, the decision to create a huge memorial in Kiev will be taken. It must stay here for ages. This process has already started. Maidan is a phenomenon that will never end.\" The origins of the snipers and the orders to fire on the protesters remains unknown.\n•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t•\t\nHonoring the fallen in Kiev\nSaturday, Mar 29, 2014 - 01:36\nTop News » \nHamas-led gunmen execute 18 \"collaborators\" in GazaHamas-led gunmen execute 18 \"collaborators\" in... \n1:59pm EDT - (1:20)\nClashes erupt during West Bank demonstrations Clashes erupt during West Bank demonstrations \n11:56am EDT - (1:05)\nBreakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas Breakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas \n10:19am EDT - (2:55)\nUN: Syrian death toll just over 191,000 UN: Syrian death toll just over 191,000 \n10:53am EDT - (1:45)\nTensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into Ukraine Tensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into... \n11:20am EDT - (1:25)\nFerguson sees much-needed calm as guard pulls out Ferguson sees much-needed calm as guard pulls... \n9:19am EDT - (1:21)\nRain hampers landslide rescue in Japan Rain hampers landslide rescue in Japan \n6:49am EDT - (1:21)\nFirst Malaysian bodies arrive home First Malaysian bodies arrive home \n4:57am EDT - (1:23)\nIndonesia court upholds Widodo\u0027s presidential victory Indonesia court upholds Widodo\u0027s presidential... \n3:07am EDT - (1:22)\nBreakingviews: Jackson Hole Special Breakingviews: Jackson Hole Special \n4:30am EDT - (5:16)\nMichael Brown\u0027s mother: \"He was just tall, big, and black\" Michael Brown\u0027s mother: \"He was just tall,... \nThu, Aug 21, 2014 - (1:02)\nU.S. pursuing long-term strategy against ISIL: Hagel U.S. pursuing long-term strategy against ISIL:... \nThu, Aug 21, 2014 - (1:31)\n \nMost Popular » \nIslamic State says beheads U.S. journalist, holds anotherIslamic State says beheads U.S. journalist,... \nTue, Aug 19, 2014 - (2:27)\nIraqi refugee camp expands to cope with overwhelming numbers Iraqi refugee camp expands to cope with... \nWed, Aug 20, 2014 - (1:15)\nTensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into Ukraine Tensions rise as Russian convoy crosses into... \n11:20am EDT - (1:25)\nBreakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas Breakingviews: Modern bad economic ideas \n10:19am EDT - (2:55)\n3-year-old girl dies after Maryland police shootout 3-year-old girl dies after Maryland police... \nSun, Aug 17, 2014 - (0:46)\nIs it a plane?
